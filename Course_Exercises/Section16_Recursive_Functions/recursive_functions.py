''' Basically, a recursive function is that calls itself.
It MUST contain to important parts > A recurrance relation and a termination condtion
This last one, IS IMPERATIVE. Without a termination condtion, we will have an infinite loop 
(remember the while True?, well. IT'S THE SAME)

Also, Recursive Functions help us solve multiple problems with simple calculations repetitively, 
instead of writing a big block of code.
