# FOR AND RANGE
# Conditionally execute till not true

# Looping thru a list. The syntax is:
# for >> the function
# in >> defines where it will be looping
for i in [2,4,6,8,10]:
    print("i =", i)


# RANGE
'''It creates a list starting at 0 and going all the way up
   to the number we define but not including that number. 
    For example'''

for i in range (6):
    print("i =", i)

i = 6
(i % 2) == 0
print("Is 6 even? : ", ((i % 2) == 0))

# PROBLEM

# Print all the odd numbers from 1-20
